TENSORS:
  Transposition : rows change to coloumns and vice versa 
    x.T # gives transpose as output 
    if x is a tensor and x+2 will add 2 to every element and every operation bahevaes that way only 

  REDUCTION: 
    calculating sum across all elemtents of a tensor is a common operation.
    for vector x of length n, we calculate 
    for a matrix with m byn we calculate sigma i=1 to m sigma j =1 to n xij 

    x = np.array([[25,2],[2,26], [3,7]])
    x.sum() gives sum 
    x.sum(axis=0) gives sum of all rows 
    x.sum(axis =1 ) #gives sum of all colomns 

  DOT PRODUCT:
    x.y     ,  xTy,       <x,y> 
    torch.dot(torch.tensor([]), torch.tensor([]))
    tf.reduce_sum(tf.multiply(x_tf, y_tf)) 
    
    


SOLVING LINEAR SYSTEMS:
  1.SUBSTITUTION: 
      x+y = 6 and 2x+3y = 16 
      y = 6-x and substitute in 2nd equation 
  2.ELIMINATION:
      multiply eq1 by 2 and solve
